This repository contains, at the moment, configurations for the Z Shell (ZSH), SSH client, and the `dig` and `vim` commands.

## Setup Script

## ZSH

- Uses the Antigen plugin manager
- Uses the Powerline10K theme
- Loads aliases based on hostname of the server
- If available, runs the `neofetch` command when loaded

*Note:  a `.hushlogin` file can be created in the home directory to silence other SSH login banners.*
